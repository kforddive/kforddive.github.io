<p>I'm new to GitHub, gaining more familiarity with RMarkdown, and exploring the blogosphere.</p>
<p>Right now I'm writing in RStudio, saving to index.html, then going to GitHub Desktop, committing the changes, and then .</p>
<p>I need to work on a method to more easily start a new post in RStudio, and it would be nice to publish directly from RStudio. I've seen a couple of posts with packages to do this, but I'll keep looking around.</p>
