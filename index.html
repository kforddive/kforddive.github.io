<h1>My GitHub Page</h1>
<h2>11/20/2022</h2>
<p>I'm new to GitHub, gaining more familiarity with RMarkdown, and exploring the blogosphere.</p>
<p>Thanks to https://pages.github.com/ - a fantastically easy walkthrough of how to get started.</p>
<p>Having a basic familiarity already with HTML and RStudio was helpful.</p>
<p>Right now I'm writing in RStudio, saving to index.html, then going to GitHub Desktop, committing the changes, and then pushing the change up. It takes about 2 minutes for the changes to go live. (This wait made me think I was doing something wrong at first!)</p>
<p>I need to work on a method to more easily start a new post in RStudio, and it would be nice to publish directly from RStudio. I've seen a couple of posts with packages to do this, but I'll keep looking around.</p>
<p>Adding a changed line to better understand branches
